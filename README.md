# Water-distribution-and-quality-management-using-Ph-sensor-module-and-water-flow-rate-sensor
Water distribution and quality management using Ph sensor module and water flow rate sensor


COMPONENTS REQUIRED

1. ARDUINO
2. ESP8266
3. PH SENSOR MODULE
4. WATER FLOW RATE SENSOR

here we get the value of PH corresponding to the voltage and using the water flow rate sensor we can find water flow per litre,volume,duration of flow

INITIALIZATION
THE SIGNAL PIN OF pH SENSOR IS CONNECTED TO A0 OF ANALOG PIN

THE DIGITALL PIN OF WATER FLOW RATE  SENSOR IS CONNECTED TO D2 OF DIGITAL PIN
